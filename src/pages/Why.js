          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Over the last few years, the explosive growth and development of Artificial Intelligence has uncovered a 
            plethora of applications in almost every industry.
            As AI has become more powerful, it has become more commonplace. Professionals in a wide variety of sectors, as well as students across the globe, use models
            like GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3 to write emails, debug code, and assist with homework on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
            While these models are impressive and beneficial in many ways, one aspect that is often overlooked is 
            their environmental impact. Researchers argue that quantifying this impact is a crucial step in addressing 
            the ongoing climate crisis.
          </p>

          <p>
            The development of AI technologies is moving at an unprecedented rate. However, as their influence grows, we must recognize the urgent need to address the environmental footprint that comes with it. If we don't act now, the strain on our planet will only increase, and the consequences will be irreversible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>We need to make sure that this technological revolution doesn't come at the expense of our environment.</strong> The responsibility lies not only with AI companies but with each of us as users. Together, we can make a difference by advocating for sustainability and making conscientious choices in how we interact with these technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The change won't happen overnight, but if we all take small, deliberate steps to minimize our environmental impact‚Äîwhether by reducing energy consumption, supporting green technologies, or pushing for greater transparency‚Äîwe can ensure that AI continues to evolve responsibly, without further damaging the planet.

          <h2>Why We Care</h2>
          <p>
            As AI weaves deeper into our daily routines, its environmental footprint grows alongside its capabilities.
            While many celebrate the breakthroughs, fewer ask: what's the cost to our planet?
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe everyone should understand this tradeoff. Awareness sparks action ‚Äî and with the right information, people can make smarter, more sustainable tech choices.
