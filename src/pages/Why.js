          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we live, work, and learn â€” but behind the innovation lies a cost we rarely discuss: its environmental footprint.
            From massive energy consumption during model training to ongoing emissions from daily queries, AI contributes significantly to global energy use.

          <h2>ðŸ’¡ Why We Care</h2>
          <p>
            As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, its impact scales rapidly. While many applaud its capabilities, fewer stop to ask: at what environmental cost?
            We believe the public deserves to understand this tradeoff. Knowledge empowers action â€” and we want people to make informed, sustainable tech choices.
